## Trees & Machines 

#### The Data

##### ANES 2008

For the first part of project, I continue using the ANES data to predict feelings toward Joe Biden, but this time by growing and tuning several decision trees. 

As a refresher, the `nes2008.csv` data contains a paired down selection of features from the full [2008 American National Election Studies survey](http://www.electionstudies.org/). These data will allow you to test competing factors that may influence attitudes towards Joe Biden.

##### OJ Data

For the second part of the project on support vector machines, I used the `OJ` data from the `ISLR` package, which contains 1070 purchases where the customer data related to orange juice purchases. A number of characteristics of the customer and product are recorded. Your goal here is to find a classification solution by tuning support vector classifiers that optimially predict whether customers buy either Citrus Hill (CH) or Minute Maid (MM) Orange Juice.
